#  Basic-Image-Processing-using-Numpy-skimage-and-Matplotlib



Create an interactive program for basic image editing using Numpy.
The program should be menu-based with the following top-level features:
1. Load Image
2. Edit Image
3. Save Image
4. Quit
‘Edit Image’ should be able to do the following using numpy operations:
1. Horizontal Flip
2. Vertical Flip
3. Invert Colors
4. Convert to Grayscale
5. Convert to B&W

Note:
a) Use of skimage to read an image file as an ndarray / save ndarray as image file is
allowed.
b) Use of Pyplot to display an image is allowed.
c) Other libraries should not be used unless there is a strong justification to do so.
